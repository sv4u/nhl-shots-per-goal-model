# NHL Shots Per Goal Model

*this takes inspiration from Github telling me to name my repo* __*`crispy-meme`*__

In all seriousness, this is a project on an idea I've had for a while.

There will be more updates to this as I continue to work on it.

## To Do List

- [ ] Goalie Analysis
	- [x] Pick 10 goalies
	- [x] Write functions to subset their data
	- [ ] Write functions to calculate their spg
	- [ ] If possible, calculate spg for the following: locations, games, season
- [ ] Skater Analysis
	- [ ] Pick 15 skaters
	- [ ] Write functions to subset their data
	- [ ] Write functions to calculate their spg
	- [ ] If possible, calculate spg for the following: locations, games, season
- [ ] Positional Analysis
	- [ ] Look at C, D, LW, RW
	- [ ] Write functions to subset data in those positions
	- [ ] Calculate spg: season and if possible locations
	- [ ] Try to make predictive model
- [ ] Locational Analysis
	- [ ] Look at low-danger, mid-danger, and high-danger shots
	- [ ] Write functions to subset data in those locations
	- [ ] Calculate spg: season
	- [ ] Try to make predictive model
- [ ] Data Visualizations
